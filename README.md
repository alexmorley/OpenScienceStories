Success Stories &amp; Examples for Open Science

This is a base to collect stories (and then share them) about where Open Science has lead to great outcomes. We especially want to focus on stories where the researcher themself has benefited from releasing their own data and/or code.

Theoretical examples might be:

**Preprints**

Posted preprint --> feedback --> better paper (more cited or whatever you think better means)

**Data**

Open Data --> collaberation --> new insights --> recognition via authorship or other from your data for insights you may have been unable to generate yourself.

**Code**

Open Code --> Someone fixes a bug or suggests a more efficient way --> Better paper, or paper generated faster

Open Code (released at early stage) --> someone shows you they've already got an implementation --> faster analysis

Open Code --> Someone else uses it --> Recognition (citation of orig paper or software)

## Where did this come from
Somewhat stemmed from the idea of Open Data open mic. Then resurfaced at a discussion at mozfest '17 facilitated by Amel Ghouila
